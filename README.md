This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating a stack overflow error caused by a missing base case in a recursive function. The `bug.hack` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hack` provides a corrected version. The error occurs because the recursive function `foo` does not handle negative input values appropriately, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow. The solution adds a base case to handle negative inputs, preventing the infinite recursion.  The solution ensures the function terminates correctly for all input values.
